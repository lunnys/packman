PACKMAN is yet another package manager written in Ruby. While inspired by Homebrew for OS X only, PACKMAN is cross-platform and supports various major Linux distributions as well. Features include:

- The same command line interface, low learning cost. 
- Doesn't have to run under root privilege. Packages can be installed anywhere.
- A package with different compiler sets, versions, arch, etc. can be installed at the same time and user can switch with ease.
- Easy server mirroring. Useful especially for campus where local computers might have limited internet access.

For more information, see PACKMAN's [website](http://dongli.github.io/packman/).
